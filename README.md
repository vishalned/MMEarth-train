This repository contains code used to create the models and results presented in this paper [MMEarth: Exploring Multi-Modal Pretext Tasks For Geospatial Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02771). It modifies the [ConvNext V2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00808) architecture to be used with [MMEarth](https://github.com/vishalned/MMEarth-data), which is a multi-modal geospatial remote sensing data.

## Installation
See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/vishalned/MMEarth-train/blob/main/INSTALL.md) for more instructions on the installation of dependencies


## Training 
See [TRAINING.md](https://github.com/vishalned/MMEarth-train/blob/main/TRAINING.md) for more details on training and finetuning. 

## Model Checkpoints
All the pretraining weights can be downloaded from [here](https://sid.erda.dk/sharelink/g23YOnaaTp). The folders are named in the format shown below. Inside the folder you will find a checkpoint `.pth` weight file. An example to load the weights is in the [examples](https://github.com/vishalned/MMEarth-train/tree/main/examples) folder.

```sh
CHECKPOINT FOLDER FORMAT
pt-($INPUT)_($MODEL)_($DATA)_($LOSS)_($MODEL_IMG_SIZE)_($PATCH_SIZE)/

$INPUT:
      - S2 # for s2-12 bands as input and output
      - all_mod # for s2-12 bands as input and all modalities as output
      - img_mod # for s2-12 bands as input and image level modalities as output
      - pix_mod # for s2-12 bands as input and pixel level modalities as output
      - rgb # for s2-bgr as input and output (we trained the model using bgr ordering)

$MODEL:
      - atto
      - tiny

$DATA:
      - 100k_128 # MMEarth100k, 100k locations and image size 128
      - 1M_64 # MMEarth64, 1.2M locations and image size 64
      - 1M_128 # MMEarth, 1.2M locations and image size 128

$LOSS: # loss weighting strategy
      - uncertainty
      - unweighted

$MODEL_IMG_SIZE # input size passed to the model
      - 56 # when using the data with image size 64
      - 112 # when using the data with image size 128

$PATCH_SIZE
      - 8
      - 16

Note: The only exception is when using the model trained on imagenet, the folder path is pt-imagenet_atto_200epochs_224_32/
